JAACPluginFramework

A kind-of framework for Acorn plug-ins. Ideally they'd be in a base class for
plug-ins, but that runs into the problem of Objective-C's flat namespace for
classes -- it could be problematic to have the same class defined in multiple
plug-ins. Instead, it's implemented as a category on the plug-in's base class.
For this to work, ACPLUGIN_CLASS_NAME must be defined to the relevant class,
and it must be declared in/imported into a prefix header. The following build
settings are useful (assuming the primary class NameOfPlugInClass is declared
in Source/NameOfPlugInClass.h):

ACPLUGIN_CLASS_NAME = NameOfPlugInClass
GCC_PREPROCESSOR_DEFINITIONS_NOT_USED_IN_PRECOMPS = ACPLUGIN_CLASS_NAME=$ACPLUGIN_CLASS_NAME
GCC_PREFIX_HEADER = Source/$(ACPLUGIN_CLASS_NAME).h
